			"Len is a consummate professional,<b> very experienced in the ins and outs, trials and tribulations of remodeling.</b> He always goes with the flow and continues to offer suggestions and alternatives until solutions are found.  I've never felt hurried to make a decision that sometimes takes me a day or two to make. I've used him numerous times on projects big and small, and recommend him without reservation."</p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i></i>  "Lelevich Construction was professional, honest, and a pleasure to work with.  The final invoice was reflective of the estimate given prior to beginning the project, and the job was done correctly.  <b>I highly recommend this contractor!</b></p>
			<p><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>  "I've worked with Len on several residential house flips and <b>can't say enough good things about his work.</b> He has remodeled kitchens, baths, and bedrooms; fixed structural and dry rot problems, finished basements (including framing), moved walls, you name it.<b> If it has to do with construction, Len can handle it.</b> He is great to work with and reasonably priced. It would be a mistake not to hire Len if you are looking for a reliable and experienced general contractor who enjoys the work."</p>
